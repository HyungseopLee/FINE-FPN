[07/20/2025-18:14:32] [TRT] [W] DLA requests all profiles have same min, max, and opt value. All dla layers are falling back to GPU
[07/20/2025-18:14:32] [TRT] [W] Detected layernorm nodes in FP16.
[07/20/2025-18:14:32] [TRT] [W] Running layernorm after self-attention with FP16 Reduce or Pow may cause overflow. Forcing Reduce or Pow Layers in FP32 precision, or exporting the model to use INormalizationLayer (available with ONNX opset >= 17) can help preserving accuracy.
