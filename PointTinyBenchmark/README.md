# PointTinyBenchmark

--------------

PointTinyBenchmark is an open source toolbox for object localization and detection tasks on top of [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection). 

To date, It implements the following benchmark and algorithms:

* [Scale Match for TinyPerson Detection (WACV2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10664) [Detail](TOV_mmdetection/docs/tov/)
* [Object Localization under Single Coarse Point Supervision (CVPR2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09338) [Detail](TOV_mmdetection/docs/cpr)
* [Point-to-Box Network for Accurate Object Detection via Single Point Supervision (ECCV2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06827) [Detail](https://github.com/ucas-vg/PointTinyBenchmark/tree/P2BNet)
* [Spatial Self-Distillation for Object Detection with Inaccurate Bounding Boxes (ICCV2023)]() [Detail](https://github.com/ucas-vg/PointTinyBenchmark/tree/SSD-Det)
* [CPR++: Object Localization via Single Coarse Point Supervision (TPAMI2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17203) [come soon]()
